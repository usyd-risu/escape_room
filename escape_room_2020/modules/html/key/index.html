   <h1>the sequences</h1>
   <p>the sequences were made to avoid groups that start at the same time all following each other around the library<br>
     each id has a different first letter and the arrays below deisgnate the order of the sequence.<br>
     for example, sequence one is abcd which means you play the game cake cat tea party caterpillar. <br>
     the rest of the challenges are connected so they always go gardeners, the tweedles and the finish.<br>
     below are the sequence orders:
   <h1>Sequence 1</h1>
     <p>
       {a,b,c,d}
     </p>
   <h1>Sequence 2</h1>
     <p>
       {a,d,b,c}
     </p>
   <h1>Sequence 3</h1>
     <p>
        {b,a,c,d}
     </p>
   <h1>Sequence 4</h1>
     <p>
       {b,d,a,c}
     </p>
   <h1>Sequence 5</h1>
     <p>
        {c,a,b,d}
     </p>
   <h1>Sequence 6</h1>
     <p>
       {d,c,a,b}
     </p>
     <p>Feel free to use this code to create your own escape room.<br>
        it's very messy and could do with a javascript/css clean up so go ahead and messabout</p>
    <h1>Happy escaping!!</h1>
